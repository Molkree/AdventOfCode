Just Python again!

Just Python!

## 2020

This year has Visual Studio solution in the root, it includes projects for C++ and C#.

If you want to build C++ separately, something like `g++ *.cpp -std=c++20` will do. Note that you will need C++20 support (tested on GCC 10.2 and VS 2019 16.8).

If you want to do the same with C#, just `dotnet run` should work (tested with .NET 5).

For Python, there is no "main" file, just run each day separately.
